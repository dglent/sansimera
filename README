San simera is a KDE plasmoid which shows (in Greek) the events of the current day back in the history,
from the site www.sansimera.gr

http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/San+simera?content=156739

To install the plasmoid, run

plasmapkg -i /path/to/sansimera

then add the widget in KDE. If you want to remove it again, run

plasmapkg -r sansimera

Requirements:
    - python-Beautifulsoup4

For development, you can also use plasmoidviewer to quickly start the widget from
command line. This way you don't have to install/uninstall all the time.
